# Credit Card Fraud Detection #

This project trains and tests pre-built ai-models for credit card fraud detection. We created an algorithm to test the accuracy of each model and return the most effective model for potential commercial use.

## Introduction ##
Ever since the invention of credit cards in 1950, there has been a constant increase in credit card fraud throughout the years, reaching a total loss of $32 billion as of 2021 around the world. In order to combat this global issue controversy, we decided to create a project that tests and outputs the most effective AI model for a given randomized data set. 

### Objectives ###
Build and evaluate machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.
Minimize false positives while ensuring high detection accuracy.
Provide insights into transaction patterns using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
## Dataset analysis 
**Total record**: 284806 x 32 - 284806 transactions each with 32 attributes (last attribute determines if the specific transaction is **fraud** or not **fraud**)
